          <p>You may only view, print out and use the Website and the Materials for your own personal, non-commercial use. We expressly reserve all intellectual property rights in and to the Website and the Materials and your use of the Website and Materials is subject to the following restrictions.

            <span style="font-weight: 700;">UNACCEPTABLE CONTENT</span>
          </p>
          <p>If you find any content on our Website to be in any way offensive, obscene, defamatory, racist, harmful, inaccurate, unlawful, illegal, infringing of any third party rights, deceptive in any way or otherwise in breach of our content standards, please notify us by clicking here and using the subject heading “Unacceptable content”.</p>

Although anyone under the age of 13 is able to participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner’s personal details for visitors under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.</p>
